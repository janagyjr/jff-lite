# TCG's Just for Fun: Lite  
## The Experience  
TCG's Just for Fun: Lite is TCG's foray into the questing modpack realm taking one of his favorite modpacks and adding some light questing! This pack, being a lite version, will also do away with some of the mods (dynamic trees and streams for starters) while tying together the blend of tech, magic, and animal husbandry that makes modded Minecraft *fun*, and in the end this is supposed to be fun

## Support Options  
You can find my pack on the [Curseforge desktop app](http://www.curseforge.com/) or on [Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/tcgs-chill-pack)  

Always get TCG's Chill Pack from official sources and you'll never have anything to worry about! Launching the pack from launchers other than Twitch is not supported currently due to certain mod incompatibilities.  Am aware of at least one issue and am working to have it fixed if feasible.
